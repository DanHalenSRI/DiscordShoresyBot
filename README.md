Discord ShoresyBot Python Script

In 2022 Discord updated their security settings and bots can no longer arbitraily listen to every message for content without approval from Discord.  Unfortunately they did not approve my request for ShoresyBot to live free.  

Feel free to branch, make changes, and have fun with it!

ShoresyBot.py uses dotenv to pull the secret token from a separate env file.  Copy your own bot token and put it in the .env file to link the script to your Discord Bot profile.
